# More complex queries with AND OR


```sql
CREATE TABLE exercise_logs
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type TEXT,
    minutes INTEGER, 
    calories INTEGER,
    heart_rate INTEGER);


INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("biking", 30, 100, 110);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("biking", 10, 30, 105);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("dancing", 15, 200, 120);

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE calories > 50 ORDER BY calories;

/* AND */
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE calories > 50 AND minutes < 30;

/* OR */
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE calories > 50 OR heart_rate > 100;

```
The 'AND' operator has precedence over the 'OR' if you've got both of them in the same query,
but you can always use parentheses to change the order of evaluation,
just like with math expressions.
