# What is SQL?

Most databases come with a Query language to interact with the database.

SQL is a language designed entirely for accessing databases, and is the most popular of them.

With SQL,

* we can create tables
* change data
* get back to data that we're intereted in
  * like we'd want to find which users joined in the last week
  * which users have a particular badge
  
  
When we're done learing SQL,
* we'll have a much better understanding of how data is stored in the apps that we use,
* and be able to use SQL, if we ever build an app.
