# Class

## What is Class?

I can make a class named "University" like this.

```java
public class University {

}
```
It's a basic form of the class. I've just declared the class and there's no contents in it. 

But it also has a important function; **can make an object**


This is how to make an object.
```java
University student = new University();
```
```new``` is a keyword which let you make an object.

so like this, I've made an object of University; student is an instance of class named University.




>**An object and an instance**

>Another name of an object which is made by a class is an instance. Then what is the difference between those?

>```University student = new University()``` in this case, student is an object. And also, it's an instance of University.

>So, in term instance is used to explain the relation of specific object(student) between the class(University).

>It's better to use "student is an object" rather than "student is an instance" 

>and "student is an instance of University" rather than "student is an object of University".



This picture can explain what the class is.
