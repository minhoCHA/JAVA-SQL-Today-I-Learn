# Class

## What is Class?

I can make a class named "University" like this.

```java
public class University {

}
```
>It's a basic form of the class. I've just declared the class and there's no contents in it. 

>But it also has a important function; **can make an object**

This is how to make an object.
```java
University student = new University();
```
```new``` ëŠ”
